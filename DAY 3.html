<h2>INTRODUCTION TO LAW..</h2>
<h3>Law is essential to any society in that it provides the rules by which people and businesses 
interact. Law affects almost every function and area of business. The authors of one business 
law text go so far as to say that “the difference between winning and losing in the business 
world often depends upon the ability to make good choices from a legal perspective.”1 This is 
because almost every business decision has legal repercussions, including deciding whether to 
incorporate a business, obtaining financing, protecting proprietary knowledge used to develop 
products/services, entering into contracts to purchase raw materials, ensuring that products 
meet safety standards, disposing of plant wastes, promoting and pricing products/services, 
entering into contracts to sell products/services, and providing product warranties and after sales service.
At all stages of business, running afoul of the law can hurt a business, while playing within the 
boundaries of the law can help the business to succeed. For this reason, accountants, who play 
a key role in almost every aspect of operations, must have a solid working knowledge of the 
law</h3>
